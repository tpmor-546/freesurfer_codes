# freesurfer_codes
set of bash/tcsh scripts to run structural analysis using freesurfer

Scripts contain code to run glm analysis in freesurfer as well as code to parcellate the brain into different parcellations and extract mean values into a table. 

Most of these scripts are copies from Andy's Brain Book https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FreeSurfer/FreeSurfer_Introduction.html and only exist here on my Github so I can share them easiy with students.
